# corintho-ai

An AI that plays [Corintho](http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/corintho.htm). Uses the AlphaZero Monte Carlo tree search and neural network evaluation method based on [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270.epdf?author_access_token=VJXbVjaSHxFoctQQ4p2k4tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PVW4gB86EEpGqTRDtpIz-2rmo8-KG06gqVobU5NSCFeHILHcVFUeMsbvwS-lxjqQGg98faovwjxeTUgZAUMnRQ). We currently assess the model to play at a 1400 Elo rating (more accurate assessment to come).
